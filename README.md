**Image Segmentation** is a deep learning project focused on semantic image segmentation using the **UNet** architecture.  
The project segments images into meaningful regions, suitable for applications like medical imaging, autonomous driving, and object analysis.

💡 The system outputs pixel-level masks for each image, allowing precise identification of structures and objects.
